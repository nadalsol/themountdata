## Description

This site has been created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [GitHub ](https://github.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

* **Jekyll** is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.
* **GitHub** is a development platform where you can host and review code.
* **GitHub Pages** is a static site hosting service designed to host your
personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository.

## Installation

First install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and
[RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/).

Then you can install Jekyll with the following command:

```
$ gem install jekyll bundler
```

Clone GitHub repo:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:yourusername/yoursitename.git
```

## Usage

Change into your new directory:

```
$ cd yoursitename
```

Build the site on the preview server:

```
$ bundle exec jekyll server
```

Now browse to http://localhost:4000

‚ôªÔ∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;**Don't forget to reload your browser to apply new changes.**

## Configuration

Site settings in the `_config.yml` file, are used to personalize your new site.
If you look in the HTML files, you will see them accessed via
`{{ site.title }}`, `{{ site.email }}`, and so on. You can create any custom
variable you would like, and they will be accessible in the templates via
`{{ site.myvariable }}`.

### Multilingual references

Indicate, for each post and page, its language (`lang`) and an unique identifier
(`ref`) to link the different translations. Jekyll will do the rest!

To do so, we will use `lang` et `ref` in the [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) of each post and page. For
instance, in Spanish:

```
---
title: ¬°Hola mundo!
lang: es
ref: hola
---
```

Then, in English:

```
---
title: Hello world!
lang: en
ref: hola
---
```

Or, in Catalan:

```
---
title: Hola m√≥n!
lang: ca
ref: hola
---
```

### Translations

Just edit the `_config.yml` file to add or modify translations.

Example translation:

```
t:
  es:
    cookie_message:
      text: "The Mount Data utiliza cookies"
      text_link: "pol√≠tica de cookies"
    ...
  ca:
    cookie_message:
      text: "The Mount Data fa servir galetes"
      text_link: "pol√≠tica de galetes"
    ...
  en:
    cookie_message:
      text: "The Mount Data uses cookies"
      text_link: "cookie policy"
    ...
```

Then, in the `cookie-message.html` file, do this to show up the translated
strings for the proper language:

```
<p>
  {{ site.t[page.lang]cookie_message.text }}
  <a href="#">{{ site.t[page.lang]cookie_message.text_link }}</a>
</p>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;For technical reasons, the `_config.yml` file is *NOT* reloaded automatically
when you use `$ bundle exec jekyll serve`. **If you change this file, please
restart the server process.**

## Publish

Jekyll's simplified build process with GitHub Pages is one of the biggest
advantages of using Jekyll. GitHub Pages manages your site's build process with
a single push to your site's publishing branch. This is Jekyll's build process
for managing your site:

1. Push file changes to your pages publishing branch.
2. GitHub Pages publishes your site.

Example workflow (assuming `master` branch is your pages publishing branch):

1. Work in the `develop` branch.
2. When your work is finished, merge `develop` branch into `master`.
3. Push your `master` branch.
4. GitHub Pages publishes your site to https://yoursitename.com.
